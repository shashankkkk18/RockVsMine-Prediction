# RockVsMine-Prediction

#Description:
  This GitHub repository contains a predictive model built to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on acoustic properties. The model utilizes machine learning algorithms such as logistic   regression, decision trees, or neural networks, trained on a dataset of acoustic signals collected from sonar echoes.
